# team11_RTEP5: Mechanised User vs. Computer Chess Board
Computer chess engines have become very advanced and are great for learning how to play or improving your skills. However, playing on a computer is just not the same as seeing the physical pieces move accross the board!
This project aims to design and build a mechanised chess engine, allowing users to play against the StockFish chess engine on a physical board. A mechanical arm will use electromagnets to move the computer's pieces accross the board, mimicking a real chess expert.
